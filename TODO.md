# Detailed To-Do List for SDG Application

## Backend Setup and Testing
- [x] Verify environment setup (requirements.txt, .env variables)
- [x] Test API endpoints:
  - [x] GET /api/health
  - [x] POST /api/sentiment
  - [x] POST /api/flashcards
  - [x] POST /api/recipes
  - [x] POST /create-payment
- [x] Ensure database migrations and models are up to date
- [x] Validate payment integration with Paystack

## Frontend Testing
- [ ] Test navigation and rendering of all HTML pages:
  - [ ] index.html (main landing page)
  - [ ] recipe-recommender.html (SDG 2)
  - [ ] mood-journal.html (SDG 3)
  - [ ] study-buddy.html (SDG 4)
- [ ] Verify API integration in frontend JavaScript files:
  - [ ] main.js (API calls, error handling)
  - [ ] payments.js (payment processing)
  - [ ] menu-toggle.js (mobile menu functionality)
- [ ] Test UI components:
  - [ ] Learn More toggle functionality
  - [ ] Mobile menu toggle with accessibility
- [ ] Check responsiveness and accessibility features across devices

## Assets Optimization
- [ ] Review and run optimize-assets.js for asset optimization
- [ ] Review and run optimize_assets.bat for batch optimization
- [ ] Verify all assets load correctly on all pages
- [ ] Check image optimization (WebP vs PNG/JPG)

## Documentation Review
- [ ] Review README.md for completeness and accuracy
- [ ] Review ENV_EXAMPLE.txt for environment variable guidance
- [ ] Update documentation if needed based on findings

## Scripts and Configuration
- [ ] Review package.json and package-lock.json for dependencies
- [ ] Test any build or deployment scripts
- [ ] Verify check_env.py functionality

## Security Improvements
- [x] Add input validation to all API endpoints (text length limits, ingredient validation)
- [x] Implement rate limiting for API endpoints (sentiment: 5/min, flashcards: 3/min, recipes: 2/min)
- [x] Add security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, HSTS)

## Quality Assurance
- [ ] Perform cross-browser testing
- [ ] Test on different screen sizes
- [ ] Validate HTML/CSS/JS for errors
- [ ] Check for security vulnerabilities in API endpoints

## Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Prepare for deployment (Render/Fly/VM)
- [ ] Update API_BASE in main.js for production
- [ ] Configure production environment variables
